##Installation Overview
Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the Node.js® web site.

##Installation Steps
1. Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site.
2. Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.
3. Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
4. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.

##Test it!
Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed and to run a simple test program:

1. Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.
2.Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28
